# Jokes
A small application with which you can choose a joke, put it on an image and share it with someone.

The application was created using this useful article - https://www.raywenderlich.com/7930-autosizing-textview-tutorial-for-android-getting-started.

The application downloads jokes from this page - https://icanhazdadjoke.com. Jokes can be scrolled with the help of an endless scroll. You can choose any joke, after which a new screen will open, where you can choose a background from the images saved on the phone. The location and size of the text area can be changed. You can also add your text to the image. After editing is complete, you can share the image, for example using Skype.
